# Kali's Default Credentials
Kali changed to a non-root user policy by default since the release of 2020.1.

This means:

    During the installation of amd64 and i386 images, it will prompt you for a standard user account to be created.

    Any default operating system credentials used during Live Boot, or pre-created image (like Virtual Machines & ARM) will be:
        User: kali
        Password: kali

    Vagrant image (based on their policy):
        Username: vagrant
        Password: vagrant

    Amazon EC2:
        User: kali
        Password: <ssh key>

Default Tool Credentials

Some tools shipped with Kali, will use their own default hardcoded credentials (others will generate a new password the first time its used). The following tools have the default values:

    BeEF-XSS
        Username: beef
        Password: beef
        Configuration File: /etc/beef-xss/config.yaml

    MySQL
        User: root
        Password: (blank)
        Setup Program: mysql_secure_installation

    OpenVAS
        Username: admin
        Password: <Generated during setup>
        Setup Program: openvas-setup

    Metasploit-Framework
        Username: postgres
        Password: postgres
        Configuration File: /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml

    PowerShell-Empire/Starkiller
        Username: empireadmin
        Password: password123

For versions of Kali Linux older than 2020.1, here is our previous credential information and root policy information.
